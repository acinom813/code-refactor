# Code Refactor

For this assignment students were asked to refactor the code and make it more accessible to viewers while honoring the golden rule of leaving the code better than you found it. Some of the changes I implemented in the HTML was to utilize comments to identify the code by its purpose on page.  I changed the  divs to better refelect elements on the page as well. For the changes incoporated into CSS, I simply condensed code by pairing like classes with one another.
